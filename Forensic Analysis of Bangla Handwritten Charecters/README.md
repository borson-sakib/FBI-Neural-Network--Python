# Age & Divison Prediction Trials


1. Age prediction model was implemented on the 5th letter. The VGG16 model was used to gain approximately 67%-70% accuracy on the test set. The final model file for the 5th letter prediction is named and saved as "age_finalized_model.sav". It can be used  to make predictions on any test set of the 5th letter.

2. Division prediction model was implemented on the 1st letter. The VGG16 model was used to gain approximately 61%-63% accuracy on the test set. The final model file for the 5th letter prediction is named and saved as "division_finalized_model.sav". It can be used  to make predictions on any test set of the 5th letter.
